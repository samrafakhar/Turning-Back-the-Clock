Java program to change the last modified date of any file

Suppose you lost lots of points on your last homework assignment for late submission. You really had it done in time, but you just forgot to submit it. Unfortunately, somehow the time of last modification on your file indicates that it has been modified since the deadline. To convince your professor that you really had it done in time, you would like to reset the time of last modification on the file.

This piece of code is here to your rescue.

## How to run it?
Run the Java file on your favourite IDE
It takes the following inputs
1. String of the form MM/DD/YYYY representing the new date
2. String of the form HH:MM:SS representing 24-‚Äêhour time in Eastern Standard Time to which the file is to be modified
3. String representing the name of a file in the current directory.

These values will be passed as command line arguments.
